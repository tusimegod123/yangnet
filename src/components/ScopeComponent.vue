                The CJAR program promotes community-led actions that are needed
                to transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively
                support development and ensure food security in a changing
                climate. We focus our efforts on solving global warming’s root
                causes including such that relates to agricultural practices
                causing environmental injustices. We believe communities
                affected most by climate change may possess and adopt the most
                effective solutions to alter global warming. YAGANET understands
                that poor people are disproportionately vulnerable to its
                effects. To recover from the worst of the changing climate
                effects. We respond to emergencies as a result of climate change
                by providing relief support to the affected communities.

                We recognize the need for women and youth to gain access to
                financial services and financial education. YAGANET believes
                that women and men need to be sufficiently financially literate
                to effectively participate in economic activities and to take
                appropriate financial decisions for themselves and their
                families, but women often have less financial knowledge and
                lower access to formal financial products than men. Women
                therefore have specific and additional financial literacy needs.
                YAGANET committed to continue championing actions that addresses
                gender differences in financial literacy and aims to financially
                empower women and young people with business skills.

                ‘Preparing young people and women for success’ <br />
                Young people especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds do
                not have the skills required to successfully compete for
                available opportunities or even run their own initiatives. Young
                people and women must possess life skills. Our program provides
                flexible and measurable Learning solutions for young people and
                women, to solve challenges in their life and enable their
                holistic social and economic development. YAGANET focuses on
                helping the young people and women to improve Self Awareness
                (including sexual reproductive health and menstrual hygiene),
                Express ideas and communicate with confidence, engage with
                others joyfully & work with collaboration, solving problems and
                take initiatives fearlessly, plan their effort with diligence
                and try to succeed in their goals, manage expectations of
                themselves & others. Engaging learning experience that gives
                youth an opportunity to master the challenging complexities of
                navigating the real world and grooms them for their future in
                the workplace.
