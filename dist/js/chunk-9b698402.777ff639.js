The situation became worse for PWDs in the district experiencing frequent occurrences of environmental natural calamities such as flash floods and landslides leaving many PWDs displaced. Many slip into a survival mode as a result of a breakdown in their livelihoods, further increasing risks of gender-based violence. The Strengthening Resilience and Economic Empowerment among PWDs is a Global Greengrants Fund supported project. The projects objectives are to; mobilize PWDs for economic recovery and access to empowerment skills to reduce their vulnerability; build the capacities of PWDs in human rights so they are aware of and able to demand their rights; and assess the participation of PWDs in development projects to inform awareness campaigns and reduce stigma and discrimination towards PWDs.

In Kasese district, For the last seven years, the district has experienced repeated floods and landslides as in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2020, and 2021. This has been as a result of the heavy rains that have led to the breaking of the banks of the major rivers of Lhubiriha, Mubuku, Nyamwamba, Nyamugasani, Ssebwe, Rwembyo and Thaku among others, which flood simultaneously at the same time from the Rwenzori Mountain. Since 2020, YAGANET has received support from partners like ACRE Uganada/PennyAppeal which supported 200 floods affected households with food packs that included maize flour, beans, cooking oil, rice, sugar, and soap. And recently in 2021 YAGANET has received support from Joy for Children Uganda and supplied relief materials including maize floor, beans, soap and also sanitary pads for teenage girls to over 100 beneficiaries.
